# Enigma-Game

Collaborators: Diego Medina, Dariel Core

This game establishes a connection between 2 players playing five rounds. Both players will have the same cryptic phrase to guess the word. Once the players guess the word, they press the submit button and the program will tell them if the answer is correct. When the game ends, it reveals how many total points each player has and whether they won, lost or it was a tie. Once the game is over, players can close the tab, and the client program will close!
